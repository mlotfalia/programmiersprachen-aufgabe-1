/* 1.7)  Glossary of C++ Terms
  ---------------------

  Source code:
    The human-readable text you write in .cpp/.hpp files, using C++ syntax.

  Compiler:
    The tool that translates your source code into object code (.o/.obj files).

  Linker:
    The program that combines object files into a final executable.

  Object code:
    Machine-readable output from the compiler, ready for the linker.

  Executable file:
    A runnable program produced by the linker (e.g. helloworld.exe or a.out).

  main():
    The entry-point function where execution of every C++ program begins.

  #include:
    A preprocessor directive that inserts the contents of a header file.

  Header:
    A .h/.hpp file declaring interfaces (classes, functions, macros).

  std::cout:
    The standard output stream object in the C++ Standard Library.

  std::cin:
    The standard input stream object.

  << (insertion operator):
    Sends data into an output stream (e.g. std::cout << "Hello";).

  >> (extraction operator):
    Reads data from an input stream (e.g. std::cin >> x;).

  Function:
    A named block of code you can call, optionally taking parameters and returning a value.

  Function signature:
    The combination of a function’s name, parameter types (and qualifiers), and return type.

  Type conversion:
    Converting a value from one data type to another, either implicitly or with a cast.

  const:
    A qualifier that makes a variable’s value unchangeable (or a function promise not to modify an object).

  Scope:
    The region of code where a name (variable, function, type) is visible and valid.
